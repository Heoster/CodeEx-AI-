# Should show: "✓ Compiled successfully"

# Expected output:
# ✓ Compiled client and server successfully
# ✓ Ready for production
```

### Step 2: Verify Production Build
```bash
# Test production build locally
npm run build
npm start

# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Check DevTools:
# - Service Workers tab should show active worker
# - Cache Storage should have populated caches
# - No console errors
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Hosting
```bash
# Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)
# - Connect GitHub repo
# - Build command: npm run build
# - Publish directory: .next
# - Deploy

# - Configure CDN
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# 1. Test PWA Features
# Visit: https://your-domain.com
# - Check manifest loads: /manifest.json
# - Check offline page: DevTools offline mode
# - Check service worker: Application tab

# 2. Test Installation
# Android: Open in Chrome, check for install prompt
# iOS: Open in Safari, check share menu
# Windows: Open in Edge, check install option

# 3. Verify Performance
# - Run Lighthouse audit
# - Check Core Web Vitals
# - Monitor cache hit rate
```

### Step 5: Monitor Deployment
```bash
# Monitor metrics:
# - Service worker registration rate
# - Install button clicks
# - Installation completion rate
# - Cache size and hit rate
# - Offline page visits
# - Performance metrics

# Tools:
# - Google Analytics
# - Sentry for errors
# - Lighthouse CI
